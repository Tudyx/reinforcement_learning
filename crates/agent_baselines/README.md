# Baseline agent

Provide some basic reinforcement learning agents.

Currently there is:

- Monte-Carlo
- Sarsa lambda

TODO:
- TU Monte-Carlo to ensure we have a 0.51 socre at Easy21
- generalize Monte-Carlo and make it play carte_pole
- TODO: try to vectorize one agent and see if the current abstraction create code duplication.
